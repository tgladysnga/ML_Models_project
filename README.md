# Machine Learning Models Project
The gym chain Model Fitness is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data. One of the most common problems gyms and other services face is customer churn. In order to fight churn, Model Fitness has digitized a number of its customer profiles. Our task is to analyze them and come up with a customer retention strategy.

# Goal
The purpose of the project is to analyze the gym's customer profiles and create a customer retention strategy. We need to learn to predict the probability of churn for each customer, analyze the factors that impact churn most, identify target groups, and make recommendations to combat churn and boost customer retention.

# Models and Concepts
- Models built to predict user churn:
  - Linear Regression Model.
  - Random Forest Classifier Model.
- Crafted user clusters using K-means.
